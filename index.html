 <h3 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;">Getting Started with LCSW Supervision</h3><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><a href="https://megancoit.as.me/intro-group"><strong>Attend my next free intro session</strong></a><a href="https://www.megancoit.com/supervision-accelerator"><strong>.</strong></a></p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What to expect</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When an LMSW is under supervision, they typically meet with their supervisor for 4 hours per month. In my program, all sessions are online using Zoom. You can live anywhere in Texas and participate in supervision, and most people participate in a two-hour group session twice per month. You must meet with your supervisor for 100 total hours in no less than 24 months, and it cannot take longer than 48 months to complete supervision. During this time, you must be employed and work at least 30 hours per week to be eligible to complete the supervision process in, or close to, 24 months.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you work part-time, you need to be working at least 15 hours per week to complete supervision within 48 months. Part-time employees will need one hour of supervision per 40 work hours (usually 2-3 supervision hours per month). Three-thousand total work hours are required before you can apply to sit for the licensing exam.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When I began supervision towards my LCSW, I met individually with&nbsp;<em>my&nbsp;</em>supervisor and switched to groups when she started to offer them. I enjoyed the group setting as it provided feedback from peers, often working in different fields, as well as the supervisor.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">How do I know if my job qualifies as a clinical social work position?</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I'm often asked this question. The board has determined that if you&nbsp;<strong>assess, diagnose and treat&nbsp;</strong>mental health or substance abuse issues using DSM-V criteria for at least four hours per week, you are eligible for LCSW supervision. Don’t get too concerned about making a formal diagnosis. In many settings, it is the physicians, psychiatrists, or independently licensed mental health professionals who diagnose clients or patients. If you’re using a diagnostic skill set and/or screening tools when working with clients or patients, you are fulfilling this requirement.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I have supervised social workers employed by behavioral health hospitals and outpatient programs, medical hospitals, home health, hospice, schools, dialysis clinics, military bases, the VA, CPS, non-profits, insurance companies, EAP programs, private practices, and even police departments and prisons. As long as you have personal client or patient interactions and utilize clinical skills, you probably meet LCSW supervision criteria.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What is a typical group like?</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Group members typically present cases or ethical dilemmas they encounter at work and receive feedback from myself and other group members. We’ll also work on understanding the DSM-V, different therapeutic modalities, medications, and how to “think” for the LCSW exam. I love being a therapist, and I want my supervisees to grow as clinicians but also be able to pass the exam. Macro issues are often relevant to our individual clients and patients, and it's important to draw macro and mezzo issues into clinical discussion.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Getting started</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Several times a year, I host free “Intro to Supervision” sessions; these are a wonderful way to learn about the supervision process. This allows us both to be sure we are a good fit for each other before embarking on the two-to-four year supervision journey.</p>
